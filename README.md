### Tensor Flow Trainer

This is possibly the simplest TensorFlow "training program" in existance. It uses the
Flask micro framework and is designed to try to identify automobiles but can
easily by extended.

Deployment is designed to be on the same server as the database. All of the storage is
Amazon S3 buckets, so the scalability should be phenomenal.

Hopefully this allows someone to Jump Start their AI project!
